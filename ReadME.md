# Notes
## ReadME
In the uploaded file we have performed dot product with 2 vectors
## What is a Vector Dot Product
***Also known as a scalar product is when we multiply all the x coordinates and y coodinates and z coordinates and add all the proudcts***

> Scalar dot product is very useful. You an read more about this [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product)

## Code
Below is the python code for dot product
```
a1=int(input("A1:"))
b1=int(input("B1:"))
c1=int(input("C1:"))
a2=int(input("A2:"))
b2=int(input("B2:"))
c3=int(input("C2:"))

dot_product= a1*a2+ b1*b2 +c1*c2
print("Dot product is:", dot_product )
```

$$a.b =\mid{a}\mid.\mid{b}\mid \cos\theta$$
